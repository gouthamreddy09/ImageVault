- **Solution:** Proper types, null checks, optional chaining
- **Result:** Type-safe codebase

---

## Section 7: Database Design & Security

**Schema Evolution (8 Migrations):**
1. Initial images table
2. Update policies
3. User authentication (user_id)
4. Soft delete (deleted_at)
5. Albums and favorites
6. Album-images junction table fix
7. Hidden field
8. Hidden folder passwords

**Row Level Security:**
```sql
-- Example policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own images"
  ON images FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id AND deleted_at IS NULL);
```

**Security Best Practices:**
1. Authentication required for all operations
2. RLS ensures user data isolation
3. Bcrypt password hashing
4. Parameterized queries (SQL injection prevention)
5. HTTPS only
6. Environment variables for secrets
7. CORS properly configured
8. Foreign key constraints
9. Cascade deletes
10. Unique constraints

**Relationships:**
- users (1) → (many) images
- users (1) → (many) albums
- albums (many) ↔ (many) images (via album_images)
- users (1) → (1) hidden_folder_passwords

---

## Section 8: Error Elimination Process

**Development Errors Fixed:**
- TypeScript type errors → Proper type definitions
- ESLint warnings → Best practices
- Import path errors → Correct paths
- Null reference errors → Null checks
- Async race conditions → Loading states
- Memory leaks → Cleanup subscriptions

**Runtime Errors Fixed:**
- Invalid login credentials → Validation & error messages
- Session expired → Auto-refresh
- User already exists → Duplicate detection
- File too large → Client-side validation (10MB max)
- Invalid file type → Type checking (images only)
- S3 upload failed → Retry logic

**Database Errors Fixed:**
- RLS policy violation → Corrected policies
- Foreign key violation → Existence checks
- Unique constraint violation → Upsert handling

**Production Issues Fixed:**
- Images not loading → URL validation
- Slow search → Database indexes (GIN on tags)
- Wrong album count → Exclude deleted images
- Hidden images in search → Filter by is_hidden

**Error Handling Strategy:**
- Try-catch blocks everywhere
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states prevent double-clicks
- Success confirmations
- Console logging for debugging
